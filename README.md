# Minesweeper Game App

Game is created as a part of my Learning experience Python, Django.

I started with few courses listed below on Code School.

1. Try Python: [https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python)
2. Flying Through Python: [https://www.codeschool.com/courses/flying-through-python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/flying-through-python)
3. Try Django: [https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-django](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-django)
4. Digging Into Django: [https://www.codeschool.com/courses/digging-into-django](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/digging-into-django)

References used to develop this app are as below:

I used many references from Stackoverflow to understand game logic as I never played Minesweeper before.
But, though out my experience I learn how to start with python, use database, create migrations, apply migrations, using templates with Django, making url REGEX.
